## Overview

This is a solution to the Bento Grid Layout challenge on Frontend Mentor.  
The goal of this project was to practice building a complex, asymmetric layout using CSS Grid.

### The challenge

I improved my understanding of CSS Grid by working through a bento-style layout. After getting stuck on the grid structure, reviewing a tutorial helped me better understand grid planning and item placement. I then adapted the approach in my own solution to strengthen my understanding.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

- How to plan a layout before writing Grid code
- Using `grid-template-columns` to define the overall structure
- Spanning grid items across rows and columns
- Combining CSS Grid for layout and Flexbox for internal alignment
- Debugging complex grid layouts using visual guides


### Continued development

- Spend more time planning the grid structure before styling
- Use grid outlines early to visualize spacing
- Rebuild the layout once from scratch to reinforce understanding



### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Bento Layout Tutorial](https://youtu.be/-muwduB2G1A?si=LQ3H3hqBrxQDqaN0) – Helped me better understand grid structure and item spanning in bento-style layouts.
